# AlgoLang

This is a complete interpreted programming language, designed to match the algorithmic language taught in Algorithmic classes in EFREI Paris. 

## ⚠️Disclaimer⚠️ 

This is **NOT** an original idea by me. I used [CodePulse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUVahoidFA7F3Asfvamrm7w)'s video serie [Make YOUR OWN Programming Language in Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD) to build this language.
